# eza: A new way to list your files

eza is just a modern way of listing files instead of using the ls command!
But what exactly is changed? The biggest change is different coloring
for files, such directories, executables, and many more. Along with this,
eza allows you to display all of your directories as a tree, which
is incredibly helpful in finding something specific or getting an idea
at the entire gauge of a directory.

# Well what else?

eza has a huge amount of flags and commands you can give it! You can figure out
links, iNodes, blocks, and many other underlying features you wouldn't get with
ls. Lastly, there's even options to sort to your liking (such as -1 to separate 
each listing to its own line)! Even you can use -s to sort, with names such as 
size, extenstion, and the A/C/M details!

# How can I install?

Many different options to install!
1) Of course honmebrew has an option:
```brew install eza```
2) Can use cargo to get eza:
```cargo install eza```
3) Windows can use winget:
```winget install eza-community.eza```
