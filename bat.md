# bat: A cat clone with wings!

bat is a simple improvement on the widely used cat command. So why do you need
it? Adds many feaures, such as highlighting, git integration, and much more!
Some great flags are included as well, such as -A where is shows all the spaces
character by character with different symbols for each! 

# Git integration?

We find this to be the most interesting feature that bat adds, as you can see
line by line what is changed in a file for a git repository! Can't remember
what lines were changed or what was removed? Bat has got you covered.

# How can I install it?

Many simple ways to install bat, such as 
1) Homebrew fans rejoice as we just enter:
```brew install bat```
2) Simple installation on Ubuntu:
```sudo apt install bat```
3) Windows can use:
```winget install sharkdp.bat```
